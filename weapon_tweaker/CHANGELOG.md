## 0.2.1-dev (2026-04-24)

### Added: Bretonnian Sword & Shield for Mercenary

Added `es_sword_shield_breton` unlock for `es_mercenary`.

## 0.2.0-dev (2026-04-24)

### Fixed: `BackendUtils.can_wield_item` hook error on every load/toggle

**Symptom:** VMF logs `[MOD][wt][ERROR] (hook): trying to hook function or method that doesn't exist: [BackendUtils.can_wield_item]` each time the mod loads or is toggled.

**Root cause:** `BackendUtils.can_wield_item` does not exist as a hookable method at any point during the weapon_tweaker's lifecycle. The old monolithic tweaker happened to load at a time when it was available, but as a separate Workshop mod the timing is different.

**Investigation:** Tried multiple approaches — string-form hooks (`mod:hook("BackendUtils", ...)`), deferred hooks in `mod.update` with `rawget` and metatable checks — none worked because the method genuinely isn't hookable for this mod.

**Fix:** Removed the `BackendUtils.can_wield_item` hook entirely. Per the AnyWeapon mod (reference implementation), this hook is unnecessary — weapon eligibility is controlled by modifying `ItemMasterList[weapon_key].can_wield` directly (which `apply_weapon_unlocks` already does). The `ItemGridUI._on_category_index_change` hook handles inventory UI filtering.

**Rule of thumb:** Don't hook `BackendUtils.can_wield_item`. Modify `can_wield` lists on `ItemMasterList` entries directly.

### Fixed: Missing localization keys for mod settings

Added localization entries for `kruber_weapons`, `es_mercenary_weapons`, `unlock_es_mercenary_dr_1h_axe`, `debug_group`, and `enable_weapon_debug_logging`. Naming convention follows old tweaker style (e.g. "Axe (Bardin)" not "Unlock Dwarf 1H Axe").

### Added: Version logging

Mod now logs `Weapon Tweaker v<version> loaded` on init so the running version can be verified in the console log.

### Fixed: Deploy workflow

`deploy_all.ps1` now deploys directly to Workshop content folders (e.g. `552500/3712896117`) for hot reload during development, in addition to `upload/content` for Workshop uploads. The fake local install (ID `9000000002`) approach was removed — the game loads from the real Workshop folder.
