# Chaos Wastes Tweaker Changelog

## 0.3.4-dev (2026-05-01)

### Fixed: Banned Weapon Traits list

The previous list had 20 entries, of which **7 were no-ops** because the names didn't match any real CW weapon trait: `increased_punch_through`, `off_balance`, `power_vs_skaven` (a property, not a trait), `resourceful_combatant`, `scrounger` (a deus weapon theme name), `shockwave` (also a theme), `swiftslaying`. The other 13 silently missed real traits like Swift Slaying, Shockwave, Off Balance, Piercing Projectiles, Resourceful Sharpshooter, etc. — so users couldn't actually ban those.

Replaced with the **31 real traits** that appear in `DeusWeapons[*].baked_trait_combinations`, dumped via the new `dump_traits` command and labeled with Fatshark's official display names + descriptions as tooltips. Banned-trait setting names now match `WeaponTraits.traits[name]` keys exactly, so the runtime check `mod:get("ban_trait_" .. trait)` actually fires.

## 0.3.3-dev (2026-05-01)

### Added: `dump_traits` command

New console command lists every weapon trait that can roll on any CW weapon (union of `DeusWeapons[*].baked_trait_combinations`), resolving each trait's `display_name` and `advanced_description` via `Localize()`. Used to gather the official Fatshark text needed to give the Banned Weapon Traits options proper labels and tooltips.

## 0.3.2-dev (2026-05-01)

### Fixed: `<<key>>` placeholders in mod options menu

40 boon-disable / starting-boon widgets referenced tooltip keys (`disable_boon_squats_tooltip`, `start_boon_squats_tooltip`, `..._deus_power_up_quest_granted_test_01_tooltip`, and all 36 `*_talent_N_M_tooltip`) that were never defined in `_localization.lua`. VMF rendered the unresolved keys as raw `<<key>>` strings on hover. Removed the broken tooltip refs from the widgets — the labels themselves were already auto-generated stubs (`"Talent 1 1"`, `"Squats"`, etc.) with no descriptive text to put in tooltips.

## 0.3.0-dev (2026-05-01)

### Fixed: Campaign potions in CW now actually spawn

The `enable_campaign_potions` toggle never produced visible results because the patch shared the campaign potion settings tables by reference. Engine-startup normalization (in `pickups.lua`) divides each entry's `spawn_weighting` by the sum of its group, so campaign-potion entries had weights ~3× the CW potions. The random sampler iterates with `pairs()` and breaks on the first cumulative weight that hits the random value (in `[0,1)`); the CW potions consistently exhausted that range first, so campaign potions never got picked. Fix: clone the entries and override their `spawn_weighting` to match the CW potion scale.

### Fixed: Boon labeled as "Reckless Swings" is actually called "Khaine's Fury"

Renamed the modified-boon toggle to "Tweak: Khaine's Fury" to match the in-game display name.

### Changed: Altar count defaults are now 0 = vanilla random

`chest_upgrade_count`, `chest_swap_melee_count`, `chest_swap_ranged_count`, and `chest_power_up_count` now default to 0 (leave vanilla distribution untouched). Range expanded from 0–8 to 0–9. Setting any of the four to a non-zero value still replaces the entire chest distribution; types still at 0 produce no altars of that type.

## 0.2.5-dev (2026-04-28)

### Added: Disabled Boons

All 172 boons can now be individually disabled from appearing at shrines, chests, altars, and Belakor's Temple. Boons are organized into 6 sub-groups: Properties, Talents, Skulls & Sets, Combat, Healing & Sustain, Utility & Team.

### Added: Starting Boons

All 172 boons can be toggled on as starting boons granted at the beginning of a Chaos Wastes run. Uses the same 6 sub-groups. Starting boons bypass the disabled-boons list and are granted to all players based on host settings.

### Added: Modified Boons

New "Modified Boons" section for per-boon gameplay tweaks. First entry: **Reckless Swings** — reduces self-damage from 3 to 1 per hit and lowers the health threshold from 50% to 25%, letting the boon stay active longer. Tooltip updates dynamically when the tweak is enabled.

### Added: Banned Weapon Traits

20 Chaos Wastes weapon traits can be individually banned from appearing on weapon upgrades.

### Fixed: Boon localization

Boon names in settings UI now display readable names instead of raw internal keys (e.g. "Attack Speed" instead of `<attack_speed>`). Localization is generated at mod registration time from the static boon key list, then upgraded to actual game display names on first Chaos Wastes entry.

### Changed: Removed redundant settings wrapper

Settings are no longer nested inside a redundant "Chaos Wastes" collapsible group.

## 0.2.0-dev (2026-04-24)

### Added: Version logging

Mod now logs `Chaos Wastes Tweaker v<version> loaded` on init so the running version can be verified in the console log.
