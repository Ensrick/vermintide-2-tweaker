# General Tweaker Changelog

## 0.2.10-dev (2026-05-01)

### Changed: Migrated to VMB build pipeline

Moved from the raw Stingray SDK build (`gt.mod`, `settings.ini`, `lua_preprocessor_defines.config`, `.build/OUT/`) to VMB (`general_tweaker.mod`, `itemV2.cfg`, `bundleV2/`). Workshop ID `3713619122` and internal mod ID `"gt"` preserved — existing user settings are unaffected.

`itemV2.cfg` set to `visibility = "private"` (overriding the prior local `upload/item.cfg` which had `"public"` — never re-asserted on Workshop because no upload was performed during the migration).
